The more water per pasta ratio, the more room the pasta has, and this avoids sticking.\r\nDo NOT put oil in your pan. Just use an ample amount of water. The exception to this rule is homemade, filled pasta such as ravioli.\r\nLOTS OF SALT – Once the water begins to boil, add the salt and not before. Wait a few seconds until the water is rapidly boiling and then add pasta.\r\nCOOK Al Dente – Only cook the pasta until it is soft, yet still has a chew. Do not overcook. Test the pasta starting at two minutes before suggested cook time.\r\nRESERVE some pasta water. Before you empty the pot into a colander, reserve a cup of pasta water for your sauce\r\nDo NOT rinse pasta with water.
